abstract = {A new type of magnetic anisotropy has been discovered which is best$\backslash$ndescribed as an exchange anisotropy. This anisotropy is the result$\backslash$nof an interaction between an antiferromagnetic material and a ferromagnetic$\backslash$nmaterial. The material that exhibits this exchange anisotropy is$\backslash$na compact of fine particles of cobalt with a cobaltous oxide shell.$\backslash$nThe effect occurs only below the N?el temperature of the antiferromagnetic$\backslash$nmaterial, which is essentially room temperature for the cobaltous$\backslash$noxide. An exchange torque is inferred to exist between the metal$\backslash$nand oxide which has a maximum value at 77K of 2 dyne-cm/cm2 of interface.},

@article{Holzinger2015b,
abstract = {An approach for a remotely controllable transport of magnetic micro- and/or nanoparticles above a topographically flat exchange-bias (EB) thin film system, magnetically patterned into parallel stripe domains, is presented where the particle manipulation is achieved by sub-mT external magnetic field pulses. Superparamagnetic core-shell particles are moved stepwise by the dynamic transformation of the particles' magnetic potential energy landscape due to the external magnetic field pulses without affecting the magnetic state of the thin film system. The magnetic particle velocity is adjustable in the range of 1-100 mum/s by the design of the substrate's magnetic field landscape (MFL), the particle-substrate distance, and the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field pulses. The agglomeration of magnetic particles is avoided by the intrinsic magnetostatic repulsion of particles due to the parallel alignment of the particles' magnetic moments perpendicular to the transport direction and parallel to the surface normal of the substrate during the particle motion. The transport mechanism is modeled by a quantitative theory based on the precise knowledge of the sample's MFL and the particle-substrate distance.},

@article{Rampini2016,
abstract = {In this article, we review lab on a chip (LOC) devices that have been developed for processing magnetically labelled biological analytes, e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, viruses and cells, based on micromagnetic structures and a time-varying magnetic field. We describe the methods that have been developed for fabricating micromagnetic arrays and the bioprocessing operations that have been demonstrated using superparamagnetic (SPM) beads, i.e., programmed transport, switching, separation of specific analytes, and pumping and mixing of fluids in microchannels. The primary advantage of micromagnet devices is that they make it possible to develop systems that control individual SPM beads, enabling high-efficiency separation and analysis. These devices do not require hydrodynamic control and lend themselves to parallel processing of large arrays of SPM beads with modest levels of power consumption. Micromagnet devices are well suited for bioanalytical applications that require high-resolution separation, e.g., detection of rare cell types such as circulating tumour cells, or biosensor applications that require multiple magnetic bioprocessing operations on a single chip.},

@book{Stohr2006,
abstract = {This text book gives a comprehensive account of magnetism, one of the oldest yet most vibrant fields of physics. It spans the historical development, the physical foundations and the continuing research underlying the subject. The book covers both the classical and quantum mechanical aspects of magnetism and novel experimental techniques. Perhaps uniquely, it discusses spin transport and magnetization dynamics phenomena associated with atomically and spin engineered nano-structures against the backdrop of spintronics and magnetic storage and memory applications. The book is for students, and serves as a reference for scientists in academia and research laboratories.},
