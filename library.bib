  abstract = {In this article, we review lab on a chip (LOC) devices that have been developed for processing magnetically labelled biological analytes, e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, viruses and cells, based on micromagnetic structures and a time-varying magnetic field. We describe the methods that have been developed for fabricating micromagnetic arrays and the bioprocessing operations that have been demonstrated using superparamagnetic (SPM) beads, i.e., programmed transport, switching, separation of specific analytes, and pumping and mixing of fluids in microchannels. The primary advantage of micromagnet devices is that they make it possible to develop systems that control individual SPM beads, enabling high-efficiency separation and analysis. These devices do not require hydrodynamic control and lend themselves to parallel processing of large arrays of SPM beads with modest levels of power consumption. Micromagnet devices are well suited for bioanalytical applications that require high-resolution separation, e.g., detection of rare cell types such as circulating tumour cells, or biosensor applications that require multiple magnetic bioprocessing operations on a single chip.},

  abstract = {An approach for a remotely controllable transport of magnetic micro- and/or nanoparticles above a topographically flat exchange-bias (EB) thin film system, magnetically patterned into parallel stripe domains, is presented where the particle manipulation is achieved by sub-mT external magnetic field pulses. Superparamagnetic core-shell particles are moved stepwise by the dynamic transformation of the particles' magnetic potential energy landscape due to the external magnetic field pulses without affecting the magnetic state of the thin film system. The magnetic particle velocity is adjustable in the range of 1-100 mum/s by the design of the substrate's magnetic field landscape (MFL), the particle-substrate distance, and the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field pulses. The agglomeration of magnetic particles is avoided by the intrinsic magnetostatic repulsion of particles due to the parallel alignment of the particles' magnetic moments perpendicular to the transport direction and parallel to the surface normal of the substrate during the particle motion. The transport mechanism is modeled by a quantitative theory based on the precise knowledge of the sample's MFL and the particle-substrate distance.},

For low ion doses (o1:5 Â 1015 ions=cm2), in a magnetic ﬁeld applied parallel to the as-grown exchange bias ﬁeld direction, the exchange bias ﬁeld Heb is enhanced compared to the as-grown ﬁeld Heb;0; i.e. Heb/Heb;0 {$>$} 1: For higher doses, the relative exchange bias ﬁeld Heb/Heb;0 is found to decrease gradually with increasing dose to roughly zero. Bombardment with low doses in a magnetic ﬁeld applied antiparallel to the direction of Heb;0 results in magnitudes of jHeb/Heb;0j {$>$} 1 and reverses the sign of Heb: For higher ion doses Heb again approaches zero. These ﬁndings are similar to the ﬁndings for the bilayer system FeMn/NiFe, but differ to those for the systems PtMn/NiFe and CrMn/NiFe. The experimental results are compared with a simulation using the SRIM code.},

Our objective was to determine whether PCA measurements at the bedside of patients in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units of the MUSC Children's Hospital would be as reliable as those performed by the clinical laboratory's primary methods (Radiometer ABL 725 blood gas analyzer; Vitros 750 chemistry analyzer; and Coulter STKS hematology analyzer). Four cartridge types: (a) EC8+ (sodium; potassium; chloride; urea; glucose; pH; blood gases [PO2; pCO2]), (b) EC6+ (sodium; potassium; ionized calcium; glucose; hematocrit; pH), (c) G3+ (pH; PO2; pCO2), and (d) creatinine, were assessed for reproducibility, linearity, and method comparisons using aqueous samples, blood samples supplemented with several analytes, and -225 blood samples from patients. Reproducibility (CV) was good ({$<$} 2\%) for electrolytes, glucose, urea, and pH, satisfactory ({$<$} 6.5\%) for blood gases and creatinine, but poor (21\%) for hematocrit. Linearity concentrations spanning the clinically relevant ranges were verified for all analytes. Method comparison studies with samples separated into 2 subgroups by patient age ({$>$} or {$<$} 3 mo) showed that agreement between the PCA and the primary methods was clinically acceptable. After the PCA was implemented for clinical testing, the observation of discrepant results of creatinine concentrations in neonatal blood samples that would have affected clinical management led to a second creatinine comparison study (59 additional samples) and to our eventual discontinuation of the PCA creatinine assay. This problem notwithstanding, the successful implementation of the PCA is attributed to careful analytical evaluations and ongoing communication with the clinical staff.},
